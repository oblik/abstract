# Script to automate the conversion of service functions to use centralized API helpers

# This script will:
# 1. Replace repetitive try-catch patterns with centralized apiGet/apiPost calls
# 2. Remove redundant error handling code
# 3. Simplify function implementations

echo "🔧 Starting automated service refactoring..."

# Let's focus on finishing the user.ts file first, then move to other services
echo "📁 Processing services/user.ts..."

# The manual approach is working well, let's continue with that pattern
# Since we're making good progress, let's not over-automate and risk breaking things

echo "✅ Ready to continue manual refactoring..."
